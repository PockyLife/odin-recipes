        <h2>Beef Filling</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 lb boneless chuck roast, trimmed</li>
            <li>1 tsp kosher salt + more to taste</li>
            <li>As needed neutral oil</li>
            <li>2 beef bouillon cubes, crushed</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp Mexican oregano</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 ½ white onion, divided</li>
            <li>9 garlic cloves, divided</li>
            <li>As needed water</li>
            <li>3-4 ancho chiles, stems + seeds removed</li>
            <li>3-4 pasillo chiles, stems + seeds removed</li>
            <li>5-6 guajillo chiles, stems + seeds removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 275 °F.</li>
            <li>Season the beef with salt, then transfer it to a high-sided skillet or dutch oven.</li>
            <li>Add to the skillet bouillon cubes, oregano, bay leaf, 1 white onion quartered, and 6 garlic cloves. Add enough water to the pot to just submerge the beef about halfway.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer on the stovetop, then transfer the uncovered skillet to the preheated oven.</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 ½ - 3 hours, or until the beef is completely tender.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, toast the chiles in a high-sided skillet for 3-4 minutes. Then add the remaining ½ white onion and 3 garlic cloves to the pot.</li>
            <li>Cover the pepper with water and bring the mixture to a simmer. Turn off the heat, cover the pot and allow them to steep for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once steeped, transfer the chiles, onion, and garlic to a high-powdered blender. Add about 1 cup of the steeping liquid to the blender to aid the process.</li>
            <li>Once the beef is cooked through and tender, shred the beef by hand and reserve.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large high-sided skillet. Add the chile mixture and bring it to a simmer. Add the beef and cook for an additional 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reserve until ready to serve.</li>
        </ul>
